     * The `Creator` is responsible to create a zim file.
     *
     * Once the `Creator` is instantiated, it can be configured with the
     * `config*` methods.
     * Then the creation process must be started with `startZimCreation`.
     * Elements of the zim file can be added using the `add*` methods.
     * The final steps is to call `finishZimCreation`.
     *
     * During the creation of the zim file (and before the call to `finishZimCreation`),
     * some values must be set using the `set*` methods.
     *
     * All `add*` methods and `finishZimCreation` can throw a exception.
     * (most of the time zim::CreatorError child but not limited to)
     * It is up to the user to catch this exception and handle the error.
     * The current (documented) conditions when a exception is thrown are:
     * - When a entry cannot be added (mainly because a entry with the same path has already been added)
     *    A `zim::InvalidEntry` will be thrown. The creator will still be in a valid state and the creation can continue.
     * - An exception has been thrown in a worker thread.
     *    This exception will be catch and rethrown through a `zim::AsyncError`.
     *    The creator will be set in a invalid state and creation cannot continue.
     * - The creator is in error state.
     *    A `zim::CreatorStateError` will be thrown.
     * - Any exception thrown by user implementation itself.
     *    Note that this exception may be thrown in a worker thread and so being "catch" by a AsyncError.
     * - Any other exception thrown for unknown reason.
     * By default, creator status is not changed by thrown exception and creation should stop.
