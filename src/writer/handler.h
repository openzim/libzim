/**
 * DirentHandler is used to add "extra" handling on dirent/item.
 *
 * The main purpose of the handle is to "see" all dirents corresponding to user entries
 * and generate it's own dirent/item.
 *
 * Classical use cases are :
 *  - Generating a index of the item (xapianIndex)
 *  - Generating a listing of the item (all item or "main" entries only)
 *  - Count mimetypes
 *  - ...
 *
 * The workflow is the following:
 * - Start the handler with `start()`.
 * - Pass dirents to handle using `handle()`.
 * - Get the dirent associated to the handler using `createDirent()`.
 *   If a handler has to handle itself, it has to do it itself before (in start/stop, ...)
 *   The handlers will NOT have dirents of other hanlders passed.
 * - All dirents are correctly set (redirect resolved, index and mimetype set, ...)
 * - Stop the handler with `stop()`.
 * - Content of the handler is taken using `getContentProvider`
 *
 *  While it seems that DirentHandler is dynamically (de)activated by user it is not.
 *  This is purelly a internal structur to simplify the internal architecture of the writer.
