libzim 7.0.0
============

Version 7.0.0 is a major release.

The API has been completely rewritten.
Most notable change is that namespaces are now hidden.
The new API is described in documentation, which includes a Transition Guide from v6.

ZIM files created with it uses new ZIM minor version (6.1 - see Header section of spec.)
Both backward and forward compatibility is kept.

Improvements
------------

 * Rewrite creator and reader API
   This removes the namespace from the API. Article are automatically put in
   the right namespace ('A') and the retrivial of content is made using
   specific API. (@mgautier #454)
 * Better handling of the conditional compilation without xapian.
   Before that, the search API was present (but returning empty result) if
   libzim was compiled without xapian. Now the API is not present anymore.
   User code must check if libzim is compiled with xapian or not by checking
   if LIBZIM_WITH_XAPIAN is defined or not. (@mgautierfr #465)
 * Add a new specific listing in zim files to list entries considered as "front
   article". At creation, wrapper MUST pass the hint `FRONT_ARTICLE` to
   correctly mark the entry. Search by title uses this list if present.
   (@mgautierfr #487)
 * Store the wellknown entries in the `W` namespace (`W/mainPage`)
   (@mgautierfr #497)
 * Rewrite Search API. Fix potential memory link and allow correct reusing of
   create search. (@mgautierfr #530)
 * New suggestion search API. The api mimics the Search API but specialized
   for suggestion (@maneeshpm #574)
 * Add `zim::Archive` constructors to open an archive using a existing file descriptor.
   This API is not available on Windows. (@veloman-yunkan #449)
 * Make zstd the default compression algorithm (@veloman-yunkan #480)
 * The method `zim::Archive::checkIntegrity` now if the mimetypes indicated in the
   dirents are correct (@veloman-yunkan #505)
 * Writer doesn't add a `.zim` extension to the given path. (@maneeshpm #503)
 * Implement random entry picking. We are choosing a entry from the "front
   article" list if present. (@mgautierfr #476)
 * Creator now create the `M/Counter` metadata. (@mgautierfr)
 * Better Illustration handling. Favicon is replaced by Illustration.
   Illustration can now have different size and scale (even if the API do
   not use this feature) (@mgautierfr #540)
 * Search iterator now have a method `getZimId` to know the Id of the zim
   corresponding to the result (useful for multizim search) (@maneeshpm #557)

Bug fixes
---------

 * The method `zim::Archive::checkIntegrity` now check if the dirents are
   correctly sorted. (@veloman-yunkan #448)
 * Handle large MIME-type list. Some zim file may have a pretty large mimetype
   list. (@veloman-yunkan #460)
 * Fix handling of zim file containing item of size 0. (@mgautierfr #483)
 * Better parsing of the entry paths to detect the namespace (@maneeshpm #479)
 * Fix zim file creation on Windows (@mgautierfr #508)
 * Better algorithm tunning for suggestion search (@maneeshpm #492)
 * The default indexer now index html content only. (@mgautierfr #511)
 * Better suggestion search : Don't use stopwords, use OP_PHRASE
   (@maneeshpm #501)
 * Remove duplicate in the suggestion search (@maneeshpm #515)
 * Remove the termlist from the xapian database, lower memory usage
   (@maneeshpm #528)
 * Add a anchor in the suggestion search to search term at the beginning of
   the title (@maneeshpm #526)
 * Make the suggestion search working with special characters (`&`, `+`)
   (@veloman-yunkan #534)
 * Fix creator issue not detecting that cluster must be extended if it
   contains only 32-bit-sized content. (@veloman-yunkan #552)
 * Correctly generate suggestion snippet. (@maneeshpm #545)
 * Better cluster size configuration (@mgautierfr #555)
 * Make search iterator `getTitle` return the real title of the entry and not
   the one stored in the xapian database (caseless) (@maneeshpm #586)
 * Correcly close a zim creator to avoid a crash when the creator is
   destructed without being started (@mgautierfr #613)
 * Reduce the creator memory usage by reducing the memory size of the dirent
   (@mgautier #616, #628)
 * Write the cluster using a bigger chunk size for performance
   (@mgautierfr #506)
 * Change the default cluster size to 2MiB (@mgautierfr #585)
 * The default mimetype for metadata now include the utf8 chardet
   (@rgaudin #626)
 * Improve the estimation of the number of search/suggestion results by forcing
   Xapian to evaluate at least 10 results (@mgautier #625)

Other
-----

 * Update xapian stopwords list. (@data-man #447)
 * Remove direct pthread dependency (use c++11 thread library). (@mgautierfr #443)
   We still need pthread library on linux and freebsd as C++11 is using it internally.
 * [CI] Make the libzim CI compile libzim natively on Windows (@mgautierfr #453).
 * [CI] Build libzim package for Ubuntu Hirsute and Impish
   (@legoktm #459, #580)
 * Always create zim file using the major version 6. (@mgautierfr #512)
 * Move the test data files out of the git repository. Now test files are
   stored in `zim-testing-suite` repository and must be downloaded.
   (@mgautierfr #538, #535)
 * Add search iterator unit test (@maneeshpm #547)
 * Correctly fix search iterator method case to use camelCase everywhere
   (@maneeshpm #563)
 * Add a cast to string opertor on Uuid (@maneeshpm #582)
 * Make unittest print the path of the missing zim file when something goes
   wrong (@kelson42 #601)
 * Delete temporary data (index) after we called `finishZimCreation` instead of
   waiting for creator destruction. (@mgautierfr #603)
 * Add basic user documentation (@mgautierfr #611)

Known bugs
----------

Suggestion system using in current libkiwix doesn't work with new zim files
created with this release (and future ones).
New libkiwix version will be fixed and will work with new and old zim files.


libzim 6.3.2
============

This is a hotfix of 6.3.0 :
 * libzim now create zimfile with zstd compression 19 instead of 22.
   So new libzim do not need to allocate 128Mb per cluster at decompression
   time.
 * At reading time, on 32 bits architectures, zstd cluster are not keep in
   cache. This avoid use to also keep the decompression stream which reserve
   128Mb of memory address.

libzim 6.3.1
============

The release process of 6.3.1 was buggy. So, no 6.3.1.


libzim 6.3.0
============

 * Rewrite internal reader structure to use stream decompression.
   This allow libzim to not decompresse the whole cluster to get an article
   content. This is big performance improvement, it speedups random access by
   2, with a very small cost when doing "full" incremental reading
   (zim-check/zim-dump). (@veloman-yunkan)
 * Better dirent lookup.
   Dirent lookup is the process of locating article data starting from the url
   or title. This improves reading of zim file up to 10% (@veloman-yunkan)
 * Add basic, first version of `validate` function to check internal structure
   of a zim file. (@veloman-yunkan, @MiguelRocha)
 * Fix compilation of libzim without xapian (@mgautierfr)
 * Remove zlib dependency (and support of very old files created using zlib
   compression) (@mgautierfr)
 * New unit tests and various small fixes.

============

 * Fix handling of big cluster (>4GiB) on 32 bits architecture. This is mainly
 done by :
   * Do not mmap the whole cluster by default.
   * MMap only the memory asociated to an article.
   * If an article is > 4GiB, the blob associated to it is invalid
     (data==size==0).
   * Other information are still valid (directAccessInformation, ...)
 * Fix writing of extended cluster in writer.
 * Compile libzim on macos.
 * Build libzim setting RPATH.
 * Search result urls are now what is stored in the zim file. They should not
   start with a `/`. This is a revert of the change made in last release.
   (See kiwix/kiwix-lib#123)
 * Spelling corrections in README.

 * Use levenshtein distance to sort and have better suggestion results.
 * Search result urls are now always absolute (starts with a '/').
   (kiwix/kiwix-lib#110)
 * Open the file readonly when checking the zim file (and so be able to check
   read only file).
 * Accept absolute url starting with '/' when searching for article.
 * Fix various bugs

libzim 3.1.0
============

 * Lzma is not a optional dependency anymore.
 * Better handle (report and not crash) invalid zim file.
 * Embed source of gtest (used only if gtest is not available on the system)
 * Move zimDump tools out of libzim repository to zim-tools
 * ZimCreator tools doesn't not read command line to set options.

libzim 3.0.0
============

This is a major change of the libzim.
Expect a lot new improvement and API changes.

 * Add a suggestion mode to the search
 * Fix licensing issues
 * Fix wrong stemming of the query when searching
 * Deactivate searching (and so crash) in the embedded database if the zim is
   splitted
 * Rewrite the low level memory management of libzim when reading a zim file:
    * We use a buffer base entity to handle memory and reading file instead of
      reading file using stream.
    * MMap the memory when posible to avoid memory copy.
    * Use const when posible (API break)
 * Move to googletest instead of cxxtools for unit-tests.

   should not be visible (API break)
 * Compile libzim with `-Werror` and `-Wall` options.
 * Make libzim thread safe for reading article.
   The search part is not thread safe, and all search operation must be
   protected by a lock.
 * Add method to get only a part of a article.
 * Move some tools to zim-tools repository.


libzim 2.0.0
============

 * Move to meson build system
   `libzim` now use `meson` as build system instead of `autotools`
 * Move to C++11Â standard.
 * Fulltext search in zim file.
   We have integrated the xapian fulltext search in libzim.
   So now, libzim provide an API to search in a zim containing embeded fulltext
   index. This means that :
    *libzim need xapian as (optional) dependencies (if you want compile with
     xapian support).
    * The old and unused search API has been removed.
 * Remove bzip2 support.
 * Remove Symbian support.
 * Few API hanges
   * Make some header files private (not installed);
   * A `Blob` can now be cast to a `string` directly;
   * Change a lot of `File` methods to const methods.
